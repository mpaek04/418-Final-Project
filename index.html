    <h1>Comparative Analysis and Implementation of Parallel Tridiagonal Solvers</h1>
    <p class="team"><strong>Team Members:</strong> Tanisha Mehta, May Paek</p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      We are implementing and benchmarking multiple parallel algorithms for solving tridiagonal systems of equations across diverse computing architectures: multi-core CPUs (MPI), NVIDIA GPUs (CUDA), and classic serial implementations. Specifically, we will implement the Sequential Thomas Algorithm, Paramveer Singh's MPI-based method (developed at LLNL), a differential equation-based method, the Parallel Thomas Algorithm (PTA) optimized with coalesced memory access, and optionally, the Parallel Cyclic Reduction (PCR) method. The goal is to compare the strengths, performance, and trade-offs of each method.
